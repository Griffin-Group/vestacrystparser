# vestacrystparser

**vestacrystparser** is an unofficial general-purpose Python parser for
[VESTA](https://jp-minerals.org/vesta/) crystal visualisation files.
It provides a programmatic API for creating and modifying VESTA files.
It is intended to enable creating consistent visualisation states in bulk,
removing the tedium of manually adjusting settings via the GUI.

This project is functional, but feature-incomplete.
High-level API for modifying specific parts of the file in specific ways are
implemented as needed or requested.
Pull requests adding more methods are welcome.
However, the low-level API can cover all cases, albeit requiring more care.

See the documentation for instructions for installation and usage.
