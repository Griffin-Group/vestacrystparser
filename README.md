# vestacrystparser

General-purpose parser for VESTA crystal visualisation files.

The initial bones of this project (namely, the basic read-write functionality) were generated using OpenAI's ChatGPT o3-mini as part of an AI Jam, with prompts and testing by Bernard Field and Musa Hussein.
But further development of the class and reverse-engineering of the file type was performed manually.
