vestacrystparser documentation
==============================

**vestacrystparser** is an unofficial general-purpose parser for

It provides a programmatic API for creating and modifying VESTA files.
It is intended to enable creating consistent visualisation states in bulk,
removing the tedium of manually adjusting settings via the GUI.
