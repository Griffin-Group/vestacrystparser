.. 
    It seems there's no easy way to automatically list the methods.
    Which is a right pain.
    I found the following StackOverflow answer, but it didn't seem to work.

.. autosummary::
    :recursive:

    vestacrystparser.VestaFile
    vestacrystparser.parser
    vestacrystparser.convert

.. toctree::
    :hidden:

    vestafile
    api_parser
    api_convert
